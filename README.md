Invoice-AppðŸ“ƒ
The app's idea:
To manage and create invoices for clients or customers.
The Features:
It provides a user-friendly interface for performing these tasks and could potentially be expanded with additional features such as editing and deleting invoices, generating reports, and more.
The Functionality:
The dashboard provides a user interface to interact with various features related to invoices and clients.
The navigation sidebar on the left provides links to different sections of the app, including "Home," "Profile," "Companies," and a "Logout" option.
Users have the option to filter invoices based on their status, such as "All," "Pending," or "Paid." This helps users quickly find the invoices they're looking for.
The app allows users to create new invoices. The "New Invoice" button opens a form where users can enter details about the invoice, including the client's name, phone, address, and items included in the invoice (item name, quantity, and price).
